## Laravel Up & Running

<p><img src="/books/laravel-up-and-running.jpg" alt="best books for learning laravel" class="book-img" />Laravel Up &amp; Running by Matt Stauffer is an absolutely incredible book for anyone wishing to learn how to navigate the ins-and-outs of the Laravel framework. </p>

Matt Stauffer has delivered a very well written book that features a wealth of knowledge on the framework and presents excellent examples that are both informative and easy to understand. It's no surprise that his book has been very warmly received by the community and has achieved excellent overall ratings on the likes of Amazon with quite a number of people raving about how good it is.

## Learning PHP

I believe at this point it's important to mention that whilst these books are very good resources for learning the Laravel ecosystem and how it works, they don't give you a good grounding on the underlying language. If you haven't got a good underlying knowledge of PHP then learning Laravel becomes a hell of a lot harder and you could end up inferring things that aren't quite right or doing things in an in-elegant way and possibly introducing a number of bugs to your Laravel based systems.

The same could be said for any language and framework. If you are trying to learn a framework, ensure you know the language it is implemented in. 

In this section of the article we are going to look at some of the top books you can buy should you wish to learn the inner workings of PHP.

### PHP Cookbook: Solutions & Examples for PHP Programmers

<p><img src="/books/php-cookbook.jpg" alt="php cookbook" class="book-img"/>The third edition of PHP Cookbook by David Sklar and Adam Trachtenberg introduces PHP 5.4 and 5.5 in true cookbook style. It presents a series of different programming recipes that the reader will work through in order to learn the fundamentals of PHP. </p>

The book has received a very warm welcome on the likes of Amazon and has picked up a fairly decent set of reviews giving it an overall 4.4 out of 5 stars. If you are looking for a book that will cover the fundamentals then I would definitely recommend this one. It's recipe style approach makes for a refreshing change from the more standard approach.

<h4>The Book Covers</h4>

PHP Cookbook covers quite a number of different topics, not limited to:

1. Basic Data Types: Strings, numbers, arrays, dates and times
1. variables, functions, classes and objects
1. The basics of web programming - cookies, forms, sessions and authentication
