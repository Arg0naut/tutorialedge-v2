Structure is an incredibly important aspect of all projects and following a standard structure when it comes to designing your systems plays a huge part in making it more maintainable. By following standards you are essentially easing the job of new programmers coming on to a project as they'll find it easier to navigate around and become comfortable with your systems.

Not only that but by following the right structure from the outset we prevent ourselves from having to perform costly refactoring further down the road and can potentially ease the transition from hobby side-project into a fully-fledged system.

## Structuring your Python Projects

When it comes to structuring your Python projects it makes sense to follow some semblance of structure or you will find yourself soon entangled in the heaps of spaghetti code that becomes a nightmare to work with. I can state as fact that it was my lack of structure that caused me a lot of pain and heartache when it came to writing my University dissertation project and if I knew then what I know now, I may have gotten a marginally better grade for far less work.
