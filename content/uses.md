I'm constantly getting questions on what software/plugins/hardware I use to record my YouTube videos so I thought I'd write it up in one convenient place and just link this whenever the question pops up!

# Editor + Terminal

* _Visual Studio Code_ - My editor of choice for pretty much everything from Node,
 to Python, to Golang. It's an excellent bit of software that can be extended to suit 
 pretty much everyone's needs.
    * _Cobolt3 Theme_ - Courtesy of Wes Bos, the Cobolt3 Theme looks incredible. 

# Recording Setup

* _Blue Yeti Microphone_ - 
* _Isolation Stand_
* _Mic Stand_
* _ScreenFlow 8_

# Hardware

* _MacBook Pro 15" 2017_
* _Apple 1st Gen Keyboard_
* _Logitech MX Pro Mouse_
* _LG 34" - 27UK850 Monitor_

# Conclusion
