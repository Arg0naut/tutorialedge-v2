Hash Tables are a data structure that allow you to store key value pairs in such a way that allows for very quick lookup. 

## Performance

"Good" Hash Tables with minimal collisions allow you to perform inserts, finds and deletes in a constant amount of time, this can be expressed as `O(1)` in big-O notation. 

Hash tables with a high `Fill Factor` will tend to have a high number of collisions and as the `Fill Factor` of your hash table increases, the performance of said hash table starts to degrade.
