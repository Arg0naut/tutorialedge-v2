## Introduction

Angular 2 is the latest iteration of the wildly successful Angular framework and this course is designed to take you all the way from the basics through to creating high-quality angular applications. 

> This course is built using a minimum of **Angular 2.2**. I've also focused on building these tutorials purely in Typescript.

## Beginner Tutorials:

#### Modules

Learn the fundamentals of Angular modules and how they are used in angular applications.

* [Angular 2 Modules Tutorial](https://tutorialedge.net/angular-2-modules-tutorial)

#### Components 

The web is moving towards more component based applications. Being able to define components once and reuse them multiple times throughout your applications is exceptionally useful. 

* [Angular 2 Components Tutorial](https://tutorialedge.net/angular-2-components-tutorial)

#### Services

If your applications interact with REST APIs at all then you'll want to utilize services within your application. In this section we look at how to build your own services that can be used throughout your site.

#### Environment Configuration

Easily configuring different applications for different environments is important. This section shows you exactly how we can do that:

#### Routing

Most Complicated Angular applications will require some form of routing.

#### Websockets

Explore the power and versatility of using websockets in your angular applications.

#### Cookies

Cookies can be very handy for developing certain types of application. They are used for a wide range of things such as authentication or even storing previous search history and favourites on large shopping sites.
