## Introduction

Angular 2 is the latest iteration of the wildly successful Angular framework and this course is designed to take you all the way from the basics through to creating high-quality angular applications. 

> This course is built using a minimum of **Angular 2.2**. I've also focused on building these tutorials purely in Typescript.

## Auxiliary Resources

If you are interested in buying books to aid in your learning of the Angular framework then I suggest you checkout my list of [The Top Angular Programming Books](/typescript/angular/best-books-for-learning-angular/)
