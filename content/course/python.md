> This course was built using Python 3.6. However some of the concepts will be applicable to earlier or later versions of Python.

Python is without a doubt one of the best languages to learn if you are interested in programming. It's syntax is simpler to follow than say, that of say C or C++ for those with minimal programming experience and it's range of supporting libraries make it incredibly powerful if you want to do complex things like data science. 

## Auxiliary Resources
