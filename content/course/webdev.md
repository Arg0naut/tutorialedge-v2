## Introduction

Web Development is an incredibly fast paced and exciting area to dive into. We've seen a huge ecosystem of frameworks grow out from rather simple roots and you'll find that more and more standalone desktop applications are migrating to a web frontend.

For beginners wanting to learn how to program, HTML, CSS and Javascript offer a very simple and instantly rewarding way to get your hands dirty and gain some form of experience. With web development you'll instantly see how your code impacts what is displayed in the browser and learning some basic javascript gives you an insight into how other programming languages work.
