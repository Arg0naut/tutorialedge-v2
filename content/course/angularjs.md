AngularJS is a web framework designed and built by Google for the main purpose of building web apps. It provides automatic 2 way data-binding and eliminates the need to manually manipulate the DOM. This is exceptionally useful as it allows developers to focus purely on the business logic behind their applications as opposed to tedious boilerplate code.

The models that angularjs uses are plain old javascript objects, this again makes it far easier to test, maintain and reuse.

Overall it’s a hugely popular framework that has seen a huge rise in adoption in financial institutions and tech companies due to its relative ease of use and the power that it brings to the table.

In this course I'll be demonstrating the absolute fundamentals to developing applications with AngularJS 1.X. We'll begin by creating a very simple admin application that will perform multiple tasks such as consuming RESTful APIs, Lazy Loading articles and more. 

We’ll begin by creating some very simple Single Page Applications or SPAs and then build up on these until we’ve covered everything you need in order to develop your own web applications using the AngularJS framework.
