Golang is an absolutely fantastic language developed by the very smart developers over at Google. It's a compiled language which is strongly typed which suits a lot of use cases where type inference in languages like Javascript and Python don't quite cut it. 

The fact that it's compiled means that deploying your go based programs is incredibly simple, you can compile it for that particular platform and you end up with a binary executable that you can just run on top of that platform without any fuss around things like dependencies.

In this article we are going to look at some of the top books you can buy in order to learn the Golang programming language.  

## The Go Programming Language 

<p><img alt="The Go Programming Language" src="/books/the-go-programming-language.jpg" class="book-img" />
The Go Programming language by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan is an absolutely fantastic book that I would highly recommend to everyone wanting to get up to speed with the language. It's comparatively cheap when compared to other technical books and is packed full of excellent information about the fundamentals of go. </p>

It's ideal for those of you who want to learn how to write idiomatic go in real-life situations and requires no prior knowledge of the language.
