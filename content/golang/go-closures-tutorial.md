In this tutorial, we are going to be looking at closures in Go. We'll be covering the theory behind them, and we'll look at how you can use them in your own Go applications. 

# Closures - The Theory

So, let's dive in the theory. 

We can create and use closures within any programming language that supports functions as first-class object. Go, just so happens to be one such language. 

> **Note -** It's important to note the distinct differences between both closures and anonymous functions which are commonly mistaken for closures. You can learn more about anonymous functions here: [Go Anonymous Functions](/golang/go-functions-tutorial/#anonymous-functions)

# A Simple Example

```go
package main
```

# A Real World Example

```go
package main
```

# Conclusion

So, in this tutorial, we covered the basic theory of closures and how you can use them within your own Go programs. 

Hopefully, you found this tutorial useful, if you did, or if you have any feedback/suggestions, I would love to hear them in the comments/suggestions section below!
