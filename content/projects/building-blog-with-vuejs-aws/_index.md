In this tutorial series, I will be covering everything you need in order to get up and running with your own website running on range of AWS services and using Vue.JS. 

I'll be focusing more on the utilization of AWS services and how you can interact with them in your own projects. This will hopefully allow you to become familiar with them and build your own projects off the back of this course.

## Topics To Cover

Throughout this course we are going to be covering the following topics:

* Building the frontend
* Setting up A Cognito Pool
* Authenticated Routes in Vue.JS with AWS Cognito
* Configuring DynamoDB
* Getting Started with AWS Lambda
* CRUD Lambda Endpoints
* Authenticated Lambda Endpoints with Cognito
* Creating a GraphQL Lambda Endpoint
* Working with GraphQL in Vue.JS

## Prerequisites

* You will need an AWS account
* You will require a github account
* You need *some* experience with JavaScript and Vue.JS

## Getting Started

Throughout this course, we are going to be building on top of an existing Vue.JS project so that we can get up and running quickly. If you want to learn more about Vue.JS then please feel free to check out my other course on the site on [Building a HackerNews Clone in Vue.JS](/projects/hacker-news-clone-vuejs/).
