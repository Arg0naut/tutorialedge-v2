Let's dive into the course by covering the theory. We'll begin by covering a few of the various face recognition algorithms currently in use and then we'll discuss roughly how our chosen face recognition algorithm will work.

# Local Binary Patterns Histogram - Our Algorithm of Choice

So, the algorithm we'll be implementing through the course of this series is going to be the local binary patterns histogram algorithm. 

That's quite a mouthful to say, but the underlying algorithm is beautifully simple.
