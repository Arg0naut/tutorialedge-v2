### Project Outline

Welcome fellow Gophers! In this course, we are going to be looking at exactly what it takes in order to get a simple face recognition system up and running with Go!

We'll cover some of the maths behind how face recognition works and look at how we can use the most popular face recognition algorithms in order to build a real-time face recognition system that works with Web camera input.

### Topics Covered

* The Various Different Face Recognition Algorithms
* Building Local Binary Patterns in Go
* Generating Histograms
* Training Models
* Real-time Video
