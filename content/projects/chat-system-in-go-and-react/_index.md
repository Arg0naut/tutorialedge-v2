In this project, we'll be looking at building a chat system using both Go for our backend and React.JS for our Frontend.

# Goals for the Course

This course will help to cement Go concepts and techniques and give you real-world experience of developing your own applications written in the language.

We'll be building this chat application up piece-by-piece, experimenting as we go to ensure that the course remains enjoyable and rewarding throughout. 

As we go, I'll be introducing more and more advanced Go techniques and how they pertain to this particular project and by the end of this, you should be a competent Go programmer with a solid application under your belt.

### Topics To Cover

* Initial Setup 
* WebSockets in Go with gorilla/websocket
* Frontend Development with ReactJS
* Docker and Deploying your Application
* Building a CI/CD pipeline for ongoing rapid development and testing

## Entirely Free

The best part about this course is that it is entirely free. By keeping this course free, it'll mean more people can enjoy it and learn from it.

## What We'll Be Building

By the end of this course, you should have an application that looks something like this:
